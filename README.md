# 🅿️ Smart Car Parking System

This project is a smart parking management web application designed to help users find and reserve parking spots in real-time. It provides an intuitive UI to check slot availability, make reservations, and streamline parking operations using modern web technologies.

## 📁 Project Structure

**Frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript)**

- `src/` – Main application source files:
  - `App.tsx`: Root component rendering UI logic.
  - `main.tsx`: App entry point.
  - `index.css`: Global Tailwind styles.
  - `components/`: UI components like slot view, reservation, etc.
  - `contexts/`: Global state/context providers.
- `index.html`: App container.
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite setup.
- Tailwind CSS used for responsive design.

**Backend (To Be Integrated)**
- A backend can handle:
  - Real-time slot availability updates.
  - Booking/reservation management.
  - User authentication and history tracking.

## 🧠 Smart Parking Logic (To Be Added)

The system can be extended with intelligent logic, such as:

- **Slot prediction** using historical occupancy patterns.
- **Real-time data integration** from IoT sensors or camera feeds.
- **Queue and priority management** for peak-time optimization.

Integration with a backend system or AI service (Flask, FastAPI, Firebase, etc.) is recommended.
